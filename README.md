**LeRobot** aims to provide models, datasets, and tools for real-world robotics in PyTorch. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry so that everyone can contribute to and benefit from shared datasets and pretrained models.

🤗 A hardware-agnostic, Python-native interface that standardizes control across diverse platforms, from low-cost arms (SO-100) to humanoids.

🤗 A standardized, scalable LeRobotDataset format (Parquet + MP4 or images) hosted on the Hugging Face Hub, enabling efficient storage, streaming and visualization of massive robotic datasets.

🤗 State-of-the-art policies that have been shown to transfer to the real-world ready for training and deployment.

🤗 Comprehensive support for the open-source ecosystem to democratize physical AI.

## Quick Start

LeRobot can be installed directly from PyPI.

```bash
pip install lerobot
lerobot-info
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For detailed installation guide, please see the [Installation Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/installation).

## LeKiwi setup on a new laptop

This fork contains custom scripts under `examples/lekiwi/` for keyboard teleop, local dataset recording, and running a CNN behavioral-cloning policy on a base-only LeKiwi (no arm, front camera only). The steps below reproduce that workflow on a fresh machine.

### 1. Clone and install

Requires Python 3.12+.

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url> lerobot
cd lerobot

python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -e ".[lekiwi]"
```

Log in to Hugging Face once (needed for dataset upload and for pulling datasets that the BC repo uses):

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

### 2. Start the host on the LeKiwi

SSH to the robot and run the host process. It serves observations and accepts commands over ZMQ on ports 5555/5556.

```bash
# on the robot
python -m lerobot.robots.lekiwi.lekiwi_host --robot.id=my_awesome_kiwi
```

Note the robot's IP — you'll point the laptop at it via `REMOTE_IP`.

### 3. Teleoperation

Drive the robot from the laptop with the keyboard. Controls: **W/A/S/D** translate, **Q/E** rotate, **R/F** speed up/down.

```bash
export REMOTE_IP=192.168.1.14   # your robot's IP
python examples/lekiwi/teleoperate.py
```

A rerun viewer opens showing the front camera and live actions. Use this to verify the network link, camera, and drive before recording.

### 4. Recording a dataset

Records episodes locally only — the upload step is separate so you can review before pushing.

```bash
export REMOTE_IP=192.168.1.14
export HF_REPO_ID=your-username/your_dataset

python examples/lekiwi/record.py \
  --num-episodes 10 \
  --episode-time 20 \
  --reset-time 20 \
  --task "Go towards a green block, no obstacles"
```

During recording: **Right arrow** ends the current episode, **Left arrow** re-records it, **Esc** stops. After each episode there's a reset phase to reposition the robot.

Append more episodes to an existing local dataset:

```bash
python examples/lekiwi/record.py --num-episodes 5 --resume
```

Datasets are saved under `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/<repo-id>/`. To push to the Hub:

```bash
python examples/lekiwi/upload_dataset.py --repo-id $HF_REPO_ID
# add --private and/or --tags lekiwi green-block as needed
```

### 5. Testing the behavioral-cloning policy

The BC training code lives in a separate repo: [`ECE534_BehaviorCloning`](https://github.com/CalvinTAVN/ECE534_BehaviorCloning). Clone it alongside this one and follow its README to build the dataset and train `cnn_policy.pth`.

```bash
# in a sibling directory to lerobot/
git clone https://github.com/CalvinTAVN/ECE534_BehaviorCloning.git
cd ECE534_BehaviorCloning
bash setup_venv.sh        # creates rob534/ venv with PyTorch + CUDA
source rob534/bin/activate
python dataset/construct_dataset.py
python models/cnn_train.py
```

To run the trained policy on the robot, point `BC_REPO` at the BC repo so `run_policy.py` can import `CNNPolicy`:

```bash
# back in lerobot/, with the lerobot venv activated
export REMOTE_IP=192.168.1.14
export BC_REPO=/absolute/path/to/ECE534_BehaviorCloning

python examples/lekiwi/run_policy.py \
  --model $BC_REPO/models/checkpoints/cnn_policy.pth
```

Controls while running: **Space** pauses (sends zero velocity), **Esc** is an emergency stop, **Ctrl+C** quits cleanly. The policy outputs discrete sign-only velocities which `run_policy.py` scales to the same max speed used during data collection (0.4 m/s linear, 90°/s rotation).

> The BC repo's venv (`rob534`, has PyTorch+CUDA) and the lerobot venv (`.venv`, has the robot client) are separate. Activate the **lerobot** one when running `run_policy.py` — it imports `CNNPolicy` from the BC repo by path, not by package install.

## Robots & Control

<div align="center">
  <img src="./media/readme/robots_control_video.webp" width="640px" alt="Reachy 2 Demo">
</div>

LeRobot provides a unified `Robot` class interface that decouples control logic from hardware specifics. It supports a wide range of robots and teleoperation devices.

```python
from lerobot.robots.myrobot import MyRobot

# Connect to a robot
robot = MyRobot(config=...)
robot.connect()

# Read observation and send action
obs = robot.get_observation()
action = model.select_action(obs)
robot.send_action(action)
```

**Supported Hardware:** SO100, LeKiwi, Koch, HopeJR, OMX, EarthRover, Reachy2, Gamepads, Keyboards, Phones, OpenARM, Unitree G1.

While these devices are natively integrated into the LeRobot codebase, the library is designed to be extensible. You can easily implement the Robot interface to utilize LeRobot's data collection, training, and visualization tools for your own custom robot.

For detailed hardware setup guides, see the [Hardware Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/integrate_hardware).

## LeRobot Dataset

To solve the data fragmentation problem in robotics, we utilize the **LeRobotDataset** format.

- **Structure:** Synchronized MP4 videos (or images) for vision and Parquet files for state/action data.
- **HF Hub Integration:** Explore thousands of robotics datasets on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/lerobot).
- **Tools:** Seamlessly delete episodes, split by indices/fractions, add/remove features, and merge multiple datasets.

```python
from lerobot.datasets.lerobot_dataset import LeRobotDataset

# Load a dataset from the Hub
dataset = LeRobotDataset("lerobot/aloha_mobile_cabinet")

# Access data (automatically handles video decoding)
episode_index=0
print(f"{dataset[episode_index]['action'].shape=}\n")
```

Learn more about it in the [LeRobotDataset Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/lerobot-dataset-v3)

## SoTA Models

LeRobot implements state-of-the-art policies in pure PyTorch, covering Imitation Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, with more coming soon. It also provides you with the tools to instrument and inspect your training process.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Gr00t Architecture" src="./media/readme/VLA_architecture.jpg" width="640px">
</p>

Training a policy is as simple as running a script configuration:

```bash
lerobot-train \
  --policy=act \
  --dataset.repo_id=lerobot/aloha_mobile_cabinet
```

Similarly to the hardware, you can easily implement your own policy & leverage LeRobot's data collection, training, and visualization tools, and share your model to the HF Hub

For detailed policy setup guides, see the [Policy Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/bring_your_own_policies).

## Inference & Evaluation

Evaluate your policies in simulation or on real hardware using the unified evaluation script. LeRobot supports standard benchmarks like **LIBERO**, **MetaWorld** and more to come.

```bash
# Evaluate a policy on the LIBERO benchmark
lerobot-eval \
  --policy.path=lerobot/pi0_libero_finetuned \
  --env.type=libero \
  --env.task=libero_object \
  --eval.n_episodes=10
```

Learn how to implement your own simulation environment or benchmark and distribute it from the HF Hub by following the [EnvHub Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/envhub)
